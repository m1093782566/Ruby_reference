#load irb/completion before use irb
$ irb -r irb/completion
#You can also load the completion library when irb is running:
ruby 2.0 > require 'irb/completion'
#If you use tab completion all the time and if it doesn't load by default, it's probably most
#convenient to put the require command into your .irbrc file: in your home directory, if .irbrc not found in this dir, simply create it.
